# SilentSync
# Abstract of the Project
The Silent Sync Glove addresses communication challenges for individuals with speech and
hearing impairments. By detecting sign language hand movements through advanced sensors, the
gloves convert them into both spoken words through integrated Bluetooth-connected speakers and
text, seamlessly integrating with mobile devices. This multifunctional solution enhances
accessibility, empowering users to communicate effortlessly and bridging the gap between sign
language and mainstream communication.
